Pet Adoption Predictor

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a pet being adopted based on various features such as pet type, breed, age, health condition, adoption fee, and more. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the adoption likelihood of pets and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with.

📊 Project Overview
The Pet Adoption Predictor model is trained on pet adoption data and factors that influence the likelihood of adoption. The project includes a Streamlit web application where users can input various pet characteristics, and the model will predict the likelihood of the pet's adoption.

🚀 Features
1. Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit to input pet details and get real-time predictions.
2. Model Predicts: The adoption likelihood based on pet type, breed, age, health condition, and adoption fee.
3. Detailed Insights: The model provides insights into pet adoption trends based on different factors.

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Streamlit: To create the interactive user interface for pet adoption prediction.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning models (Logistic Regression).
4. Joblib: For saving and loading trained models.
5. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data insights.

💡 How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing:
   a. The data is cleaned and processed, including handling missing and duplicate data.
   b. Categorical variables such as Pet Type, Breed, and Color are encoded using LabelEncoder.
   c. Feature engineering is applied to create new interaction columns like Age-Shelter Relation and Age-Fee Interaction.

3. Model Training:
   a. A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict the likelihood of adoption.
   b. The model is trained on features like pet type, breed, size, vaccination status, age, health condition, and adoption fee.
   c. The trained model and scaler are saved using joblib for easy loading during prediction.

4. Prediction:
   a. When users input the pet details in the Streamlit interface, the input data is encoded and transformed similarly to the training data.
   b. The model predicts the adoption likelihood and displays it to the user.
